# Gefeliciteerd Werner! - Tennisspel

Welcome to **Gefeliciteerd Werner!**, a fun tennis-themed game developed in celebration of Werner's special day! This interactive game allows Werner to play against Michael in a fast-paced, challenging, and entertaining tennis rally.

## Game Overview

The game is a simple yet dynamic tennis game where Werner is the playable character, and Michael is the computer-controlled opponent. The goal is to keep the rally going for as long as possible, with the ball speed increasing after every 10 successful shots.

## How to Play

- **Move Werner**: Click or tap anywhere on Werner's side of the court (right side) to make Werner move towards that position. Werner has a limited speed, so plan his movements carefully!
- **Game Rules**: Keep the ball in play by hitting it back to Michael. The game speeds up every 10 shots with the message "Nu wat sneller, Werner!" displayed briefly on the screen.
- **Reset**: If either player misses, the rally resets with the message "Mooie punt! Nog een keer!" and the game restarts at a slower speed.

## Features

- **Touch and Click Controls**: Control Werner by clicking or touching on his side of the court.
- **Dynamic Speed**: The ball speed increases every 10 shots, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on smartphones and desktops, making it accessible anywhere.
